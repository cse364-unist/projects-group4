On this page, users can view the preview image cover of the movie along with detailed information including its rating, release date, country of origin, director, genre, language, runtime, and plot synopsis. 

Additionally, we've included an interactive bar chart below this data. This bar chart allows users to explore differences in ratings by navigating through various criteria.Users can customize the bar chart by including or excluding certain criteria, such as considering ratings from males only, or considering ratings from different age categories (youth 1-24, adults 25-55, and elderly 56+).

Below the bar chart, users have the option to submit their own rating for the movie on a scale of 1 to 5. This interactive feature enhances user engagement and allows them to contribute to the community's ratings of the movie.
