### 1. Descriptions of each feature implemented on what it does

Smart review summary using interactive plots (Summarizer) - Concise and informative summaries generated by NLP algorithms, providing key insights on movie. For Plot Generation, we implemented API for preprocessing data.

Recap Feature - It grants users their monthly/annual statistics to see which movies they liked and what ratings they gave in a simple and engaging way, with an option to share this data with friends.

Achievement Feature - Gamification, Engagement, and Goal Setting.

### 2. Descriptions of changes from the proposal, if any.

Due to the limit of our resources, we are not able to have fully functional LLM models, nor afford LLM APIs.
Instead, state-of-the-art summary algorithm was chosen to be implemented: Interactive Bar Chart.

### 3. List of REST APIs implemented for each feature and their descriptions of what they do.

1) `GET /ratings/summary/{movieId} - Gets necessary data for plot.`
2) `GET /summaries/ - Gets all summaries.`
3) `POST /summaries/ - Posts new summary.`
4) `PUT /summaries/{id} - Update summary.`
5) `DELETE /summaries/{id} - Delete summary.`

6) `GET /recap/{userId}?currentTime&deltaTime - Gets recap for specific user from period [currentTime-deltaTime; currentTime].`

7) `GET /achievements/ - Get all achievements.`
8) `POST /achievements/ - Post new achievement.`
9) `PUT /achievements/{userId}/{achievement} - Update achievement.`
10) `DELETE /achievements/{userId}/{achievement} - Delete achievement.`
In addition, we have implemented wrapper around Review CRUD's so that it will update Achievements automatically. 
 
### 4. List of example curl commands for each REST API and the expected output of each curl command.
