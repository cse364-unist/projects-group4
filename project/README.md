### What PotoMovies is about?
Our service aims to simplify the movie review process and provide an engaging way to interact with the system for users. Also, it reduces the time and effort sorting through extensive reviews. In addition, it presents quick insights from reviews with trend visualizations. Application provides:

1) Smart review summary using interactive plots (Summarizer) - Concise and informative summaries generated by NLP algorithms, providing key insights on movies. For Plot Generation, we implemented an API for preprocessing data.
2) Recap Feature -- It grants users their monthly/annual statistics to see which movies they liked and what ratings they gave in a simple and engaging way, with an option to share this data with friends.
3) Achievement Feature -- Gamification, Engagement, and Goal Setting.

## How It Works and How to Use Each Page

### 1) Main Page

This is the homepage of our application. It displays a menu bar featuring various places you can visit:

* Clicking on the [PotoMovies] button returns user to Main Page.
* Clicking on the [Register] button will redirect the user to the Register Page, where user can register to the service.
* Clicking on the [Login] button will redirect the user to the Login Page, where user can login to the service.
* Clicking on the [Recap] button will redirect the user to the Recap Page.
* Clicking on the [Achievements] button will redirect the user to the Achievements Page.
* The Search Bar allows users to search for movies by their names (for example: "Toy Story"). When a user enters a movie name and clicks search, the system presents the matching movie options. By clicking on a movie title from the search results, users can view the Movie Page, where we've implemented our Summary feature.
